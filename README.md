# SMR-City-Resilience-Dynamics
# The main objective of the Smart Mature Resilience (SMR) EU project is to develop the European Resilience Management Guideline (ERMG) that aims to help in the operationalization of the resilience building process of European cities. This ERMG integrates five complementary tools that will enhance significantly the CITY resilience defined as the ability “to resist, absorb, adapt to and recover from acute shocks and chronic stressed to keep critical services functioning, and to monitor and learn from on-going processes through city and cross-regional collaboration, to increase adaptive abilities and strengthen preparedness by anticipating and appropriately responding to future challenges”. These five tools are: 1) a Resilience Maturity Model (RMM), 2) a Risk Systemicity Questionnaire (RSQ), 3) a Portfolio of Resilience Building Policies (RBP), 4) a City Resilience Dynamics tool (CRD) and 5) a Resilience Information Portal.
# The CRD tool aims at providing a training tool for cities to understand and learn about how the resilience building process should be in cities and also, to understand the functioning of the RMM and the dynamics of the resilience policies defined in the RMM. This tool complements the RMM and the RBP tools since it explicates the dynamics of the resilience policies and the interrelationships among them. Furthermore, it shows how the resilience level of the city will improve considering the strategy followed regarding the policy implementation.
